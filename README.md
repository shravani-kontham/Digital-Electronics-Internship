# DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 
# What is Digital Electronics
Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with discrete signals and circuits, as opposed to analog electronics which handles continuous signals. Digital circuits use binary logic (0 and 1) and Boolean algebra to process and store information. These circuits are the foundation of modern computers, digital communications, and numerous other technological applications. 
# Applications Of Digital Electronics
1. computation
2. communication systems
3. Automation and robotics
4. Iot smart devices
5. Home appliances
6. medical devices
7. Transportation 
8. military
# Digital vs Analog signals
|**Digital signal**                         |**Analog Signal**                      | 
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|continous:They vary smoothly and continuosly over time,They can take on any value within in aspecified range|Discrete: They have specific, defined values,typically represented by 0s and 1s.|
|Infinite Values: They can take on any value within a specified range|Binary: They represent information using binary code, the foundation of digital|
|Examples: Sound waves, light waves, andthe voltage from a battery|Examples: Computer data, digital radio transmissions, and digital image|
|Susceptible to Noise: They can easily be affected by noise and interference during transmission|Noise Immunity: They are more resistant to noise and interference, making them reliable for data transmission|
|Used in: Audio systems, sensors, and traditional communication systems|Used in: Computers, digital communication systems and many modern technologies|
