# DIGITAL ELECTRONICS 
# What is Digital Electronics
Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with discrete signals and circuits, as opposed to analog electronics which handles continuous signals. Digital circuits use binary logic (0 and 1) and Boolean algebra to process and store information. These circuits are the foundation of modern computers, digital communications, and numerous other technological applications. 
# Applications Of Digital Electronics
1. computation
2. communication systems
3. Automation and robotics
4. Iot smart devices
5. Home appliances
6. medical devices
7. Transportation 
8. military
# Digital vs Analog signals
|**Digital signal**                         |**Analog Signal**                      | 
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|continous:They vary smoothly and continuosly over time,They can take on any value within in aspecified range|Discrete: They have specific, defined values,typically represented by 0s and 1s.|
|Infinite Values: They can take on any value within a specified range|Binary: They represent information using binary code, the foundation of digital|
|Examples: Sound waves, light waves, andthe voltage from a battery|Examples: Computer data, digital radio transmissions, and digital image|
|Susceptible to Noise: They can easily be affected by noise and interference during transmission|Noise Immunity: They are more resistant to noise and interference, making them reliable for data transmission|
|Used in: Audio systems, sensors, and traditional communication systems|Used in: Computers, digital communication systems and many modern technologies|

   # Logic Levels
In digital electronics, a logic level is the voltage representing a specific state,typically a binary digit (0 or1) in a digital circuit. These levels are crucial  for how devices process and transmit data, ensuring reliable communication between components.

 Positive Logic: 0V typically represents 0, and+5V or +3.3V represents 1.
 
 Negative Logic: High voltage represents 0, and low voltage represents 1.
 # Number Systems 
 In digital electronics, number systems are crucial for representing and manipulating data within electronic circuits. The most important number systems are binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16), with decimal (base 10) being used for human understanding. Binary is fundamental because digital systems primarily operate using two states (0 and 1).

# Binary Number System(Base 2)
1. Uses only two digits: 0 and 1. 
2.  Each position represents a power of 2.
  
  Example: 10101 (binary) = 21 + 23 + 20 = 101 (decimal)
# Dicimal Number System(Base 10)
1.  Each position represents a power of 10.
2.  The system we commonly use in everyday life.
  
 Example: 234 (decimal) = 2 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1 + 4 * 10^0 = 234
# Hexa Decimal Number System(Base 16)
1.  Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15).
2.  Each position represents a power of 16.
3.  Used as a shorthand for binary (each 4-bit group of binary can be
   represented by one hexadecimal digit).

  Example: AB (hexadecimal) = 10 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0 = 171 (decimal)
# Octal Number System(Base 8)
1. Uses digits 0-7. 
2. Each position represents a power of 8. 
3. Used as a shorthand for binary (each 3-bit group of binary can be represented by one octal digit).
 
Example: 234 (octal) = 2 * 8^2 + 3 * 8^1 + 4 * 8^0 = 156 (decimal)
